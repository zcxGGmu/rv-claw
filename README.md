</div>

ScienceClaw is a personal research assistant built with [LangChain DeepAgents](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) and [AIO Sandbox](https://github.com/agent-infra/sandbox) infrastructure, adopting a completely new architecture beyond OpenClaw. It offers stronger security, better transparency, and a more user-friendly experience.

## ✨ Why ScienceClaw

<table>
<tr>
<td width="37%" valign="top">

### 🔒 Security First

ScienceClaw runs entirely inside **Docker containers**. The agent cannot access your host system, personal files, or environment variables. All code execution happens in an **isolated sandbox**, and generated data stays in a local `./workspace` directory — nothing is uploaded to external servers. Deploy with confidence on your own machine.

</td>
<td width="32%" valign="top">

### 👁️ Full Transparency

Every step of the agent's workflow is **visible and traceable** — from web search and data crawling, to reasoning and tool invocation, to final report generation. You always know where results come from, what actions were taken, and how conclusions were reached. Inspect any step at any time.

</td>
<td width="31%" valign="top">

### 🚀 Ready Out of the Box

No tedious configuration needed. ScienceClaw ships with curated tools and skill packages — launch the entire environment with **a single command**. Whether you're a researcher, developer, or student, you can get started immediately. Focus on real tasks, not setup.

### 🛠️ Developers — Build from Source

```bash
docker compose up -d --build
```

> Builds all images from source code. Ideal for developers who need to modify the code. The first build downloads dependencies and may take longer.

## 🔧 Tools & Skills System

### 🧪 1,900+ Built-in Scientific Tools

ScienceClaw integrates **ToolUniverse**, a unified ecosystem of 1,900+ scientific tools spanning **multiple disciplines**:

| Domain | Capabilities |
|---|---|
| 💊 **Drug Discovery & Biomedicine** | Target identification (OpenTargets), ADMET prediction, drug safety (FAERS), protein analysis (UniProt, PDB, AlphaFold), genomics (GWAS, GTEx), clinical trials |
| 🔭 **Astronomy & Space Science** | SIMBAD astronomical objects, SDSS sky survey, NASA exoplanet archive, JPL Horizons ephemeris, NASA DONKI solar events, small body database |
| 🌍 **Earth & Environmental Science** | USGS earthquakes & hydrology, ERDDAP ocean/climate data, SoilGrids, air quality (WAQI), OpenMeteo weather/climate, marine regions |
| ⚗️ **Chemistry & Materials** | COD crystal structures, molecular property prediction, SMILES-based analysis, compound similarity, chemical computation |
| 🌱 **Biodiversity & Ecology** | GBIF species records, OBIS marine biodiversity, POWO plant taxonomy, WoRMS marine species, eBird taxonomy, paleobiology database |
| 📊 **Social Science & Statistics** | World Bank indicators, Eurostat, US Census population data, Wikidata knowledge graph, DBpedia |
| 📚 **Academic Literature** | Multi-source search (PubMed, arXiv, OpenAlex, Semantic Scholar, DBLP, INSPIRE-HEP, Crossref, DOAJ, CORE) |
| 🤖 **Data Science & Computing** | HuggingFace models/datasets, OpenML, GitHub repositories, scientific computing software, image processing |

### 🛠️ Four-Layer Tool Architecture

| Layer | Description | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| 🔧 **Built-in Tools** | Core search & crawl capabilities | `web_search`, `web_crawl` |
| 🧪 **ToolUniverse** | 1,900+ scientific tools, ready to use | UniProt, OpenTargets, FAERS, PDB, ADMET, etc. |
| 📦 **Sandbox Tools** | File operations & code execution | `read_file`, `write_file`, `execute`, `shell` |
| 🛠️ **Custom @tool** | User-defined Python functions, hot-loaded from `Tools/` | Your own tools |

### 🎨 Custom Tools

ScienceClaw makes it easy to extend with your own tools:

- **Natural language creation** — Simply describe what you want in chat, and the agent will create, test, and save a new tool for you automatically.
- **Manual mounting** — Drop any Python file with `@tool` decorated functions into the `Tools/` directory; they are auto-detected and hot-loaded without restart.

### 🧠 Skill System

Skills are **structured instruction documents (SKILL.md)** that guide the Agent through complex, multi-step workflows. Unlike tools (executable code), skills act as the Agent's "playbook" — defining strategies, rules, and best practices.

#### Built-in Skills

| Skill | Purpose |
|---|---|
| 📄 **pdf** | Read, create, merge, split, OCR, and generate professional PDF research reports |
| 📝 **docx** | Create and edit Word documents with cover pages, TOC, tables, and charts |
| 📊 **pptx** | Generate and edit PowerPoint slide decks |
| 📈 **xlsx** | Create and manipulate Excel spreadsheets, CSV/TSV data processing |
| 🛠️ **tool-creator** | Create & upgrade custom @tool functions (write → test → save) |
| 📝 **skill-creator** | Create & refine skills with draft → test → review → iterate |
| 🔍 **find-skills** | Search, discover & install community skills from the open ecosystem |
| 🧪 **tooluniverse** | Unified access to 1,900+ scientific tools |

#### Multi-Format Report Generation

ScienceClaw can produce professional research deliverables in **4 document formats**:

| Format | Features |
|---|---|
| **PDF** | Cover page, table of contents, charts (bar/pie/line), in-text citations, references, academic styling |
| **DOCX** | Cover page, TOC, tables, images, blue-superscript citations, Word-native formatting |
| **PPTX** | Slide decks with titles, bullet points, images, speaker notes |
| **XLSX** | Data tables, charts, multi-sheet workbooks, CSV/TSV export |

#### Custom Skills

- **Natural language creation** — Describe your workflow in chat, and the agent will draft, test, and save a new skill for you.
- **Manual installation** — Place a folder with a `SKILL.md` file into the `Skills/` directory. The agent automatically matches and loads relevant skills based on user intent.
- **Community ecosystem** — Discover and install skills from the open community with the built-in `find-skills` capability.

## 🗑️ Uninstall

ScienceClaw is built entirely on Docker, so uninstalling it is clean and simple — it has **no side effects on your host system**.

```bash
# Stop and remove all containers
docker compose down

# (Optional) Remove downloaded images to free up disk space
docker compose down --rmi all --volumes
```

Then simply delete the project folder:

```bash
rm -rf /path/to/ScienceClaw
```

That's it. No residual files, no registry entries, no system-level changes.
